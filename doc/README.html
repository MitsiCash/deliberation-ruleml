  This directory contains automatically-generated schema docs for anchor languages of the Deliberation PSOA RuleML 1.03 family. The normalized serialization is documented, for brevity. A selection of three anchor languages is made available, from the maximal language <a href="naffologeqPSOA_normal">naffologeqPSOA</a>, to the intermediate <a href="hornlogPSOA">hornlogPSOA</a>, to the minimal <a href="datalogPSOA">datalogPSOA</a>.
